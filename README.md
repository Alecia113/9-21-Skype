<p> 1. From the sources you have found already, follow 2-5 notebooks related to the topic (retail, detailing for small categories, long- and short- time predictions making). </p>
<p> Better they will contain sufficient data together with a sufficient data processing flow (reading the data, cleaning the data) and model preparation. </p>
<p> At least one of the notebooks should relate to Australian data. </p>
<p> Try to repeat them in your local environment. </p>

<p> 2. Follow these two tutorials (locally or at Google Colab): </p>
<p> https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/time_series </p>
<p> https://keras.io/examples/timeseries/timeseries_classification_from_scratch/ </p>
<p> Provide the files written (jupyter notebooks, scripts, requirements.txt, etc.) </p>

<p> 3. Based on 1 and 2, train and apply any simple neural network model to the retail data.</p>
<p>  Provide the files written (jupyter notebooks, scripts, requirements.txt, etc.)</p>
